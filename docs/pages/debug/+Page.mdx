In general, if you run into any issues with Vike, we recommend that you <Link href="/faq#how-can-i-reach-out-for-help">reach out to us</Link>.

> If you report a Vike bug, then we quickly fix it (usually within 24 hours).

That said, you can also dig into issues yourself.

> In some situations, you may want to dig into a problem yourself. For example, if we ask you to provide a minimal reproduction, it might be quicker to dig into Vike's source code instead.


## Verbose errors

Vike prettifies transpilation errors, such as errors thrown by [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

While Vike is careful about not removing relevant information, it may mistakenly do so. In that case [create a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/new). Until a Vike maintainer fixes the issue you can use the debug flag `DEBUG=vike:error`.

```shell
# - Show verbose original errors
# - Show infinite stack traces (`Error.stackTraceLimit = Infinity`)
DEBUG=vike:error npm run dev
```

For even more information:

```shell
# Usually only used by Vike maintainers
DEBUG=vike:error,vike:log npm run dev
```


## Digging into `node_modules/`

The quickest way to dig into Vike is by:
 - Directly modifying the built code at `node_modules/vike/dist/esm/**/*.js`, for example to:
   - Inject `console.log()` to gather insights.
   - Try to fix the bug.
 - Reading the TypeScript source code (`$ git clone git@github.com:vikejs/vike`), to understand how the code works.

The trick here is to directly modify the built code at `node_modules/`, while using the TypeScript source code to navigate and read code.

> We recommend directly manipulating `node_modules/vike/dist/esm/**/*.js` because it's simpler and quicker than building Vike. That said, you can also build and then link Vike:
> ```bash
> $ git clone git@github.com:vikejs/vike
> $ cd vike/vike/
> $ pnpm install
> $ pnpm run dev
> $ cd ../../my-app/
> $ pnpm link ../vike/vike/
> ```

> It may sound scary to dig into foreign source code, but it's sometimes quicker to find the root cause of your problem than treating Vike as a black box. Also:
> - It's more interesting. (Open Source is usually well-written and pleasurable to read.)
> - You may end up being able to make a PR solving your problem and help the whole community.

> We recommend this practice not only for Vike, but also for other tools such as Vite.


## Debug flags

### Vike flags

You can use Vike's debug flags to gather insights.

```shell
# Verbose errors
DEBUG=vike:error npm run dev
# Inspect where logs come from (also non-Vike logs)
DEBUG=vike:log npm run dev
# Inspect Vike's routing
DEBUG=vike:routing npm run dev
# Inspect HTTP Streaming
DEBUG=vike:stream npm run dev
# Enabling multiple debug flags
DEBUG=vike:log,vike:error npm run dev
```

> Most debug flags also work for build (e.g. `$ DEBUG=vike:error npm run build`) and production (e.g. `$ DEBUG=vike:log node dist/server/index.mjs`).

> There are [more debug flags](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/blob/main/vike/utils/debug.ts) but note that they are meant for Vike maintainers. Feel free to reach out if you want more debug logs.

### Vite flags

Enable and discover all Vite debug flags:

```shell
DEBUG=vite:* npm run dev
```

You can then cherry-pick a debug flag e.g. `$ DEBUG=vite:deps npm run dev`.
