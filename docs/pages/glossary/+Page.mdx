Common terminology used in web development.


## Isomorphic

*Isomorphic code* (aka *universal code*) is code that can be loaded and executed on both the client- and server-side.


## HMR

*HMR* (**H**ot **M**odule **R**eplacement, aka live reload) is a development feature that updates modules in a running application without requiring a full page reload, preserving application state.

## SSG

*SSG* (**S**tatic **S**ite **G**generation, aka pre-rendering) is a web development approach where all pages are pre-rendered to HTML at build time, so that your app consists only of static assets that can be easily deployed to any static host, resulting in fast and inexpensive (usually free) hosting.

Technically speaking: an SSG app is an app where *all* pages are pre-rendered (i.e. <Link href="/prerender#partial">`prerender.partial`</Link> is `false`).

For more information see <Link href="/pre-rendering" />.
