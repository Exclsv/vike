## Isomorphic

## HMR

## SSG

*SSG* (**S**tatic **S**ite **G**generation, aka pre-rendering) is a web development approach where all pages are pre-rendered to HTML at build time, so that your app consists only of static assets that can be easily deployed to any static host, resulting in fast and inexpensive (usually free) hosting.
